# US-Bike-Sharing-System
### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree projects.

This project aims at providing an interactive environment that enables the user to filter the dataset to extract specific information and see the main statistical results about the data he extracted. The system asks the user to enter the city he wants to get data about, and gives him the choice to filter the data with a particular month or day and make some statistical caculations based on the filters he made. Then it asks him whether or not he wants to see 5 rows of the raw data, and as well as his answer is Yes it will keep showing him the next 5 rows of the data.

The dataset is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a North America's bike share leader that allows users in multiple large cities in USA to rent a bike for a short-time period. It consists of randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities.
